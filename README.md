# sql-challenge

Techniques Demonstrated:
* Data Modeling: Exported code and image of the ERD for SQL database. http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com
* Data Engineering: Used SQL code ERD generated code to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
* Data Analysis: Queried the table schema by joining tables to answer questions on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s.
* Import the SQL database into Pandas.

Repository Navigation:
1. CSV data: 6 CSV’s holding the raw data which was analyzed.
2. Code:
  1. Table_Schema_non-ERD.sql: formulating the tables and their corresponding relationships from SQL code. This is the file I used for all the  queries and bonus portion.
  2. Table_Schema ERD.sql: formulating the tables and their corresponding relationships from exporting the ERD code.
  3. Query.sql: Data table merging and code to find answers within the CSV’s
  4. Bonus.ipynb: Imported EmployeeSQL database into Jupyter Notebook to analyze key salary trends using Pandas.
3. Images and ERD: contains images that were generated in the Jupyter Notebook using ‘Bonus.ipynb’ code.
